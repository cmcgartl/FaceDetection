# Facial Recognition Web App

This is a facial recognition web application that allows allows a user to use their live webcam feed or upload a photo and perform facial recognition using the pre-trained face-api.js libryary built on TensorFlow.js. The facial recognition creates an overlay indicating the location and size of detected faces, as well as predicted name, age, gender, and expression. 

This app was built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Redux**, styled using **CSS**, **HTML**, and **Bootstrap**, and deployed to **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** via **Firebase Hosting**.
